What is an automata?
====================

When dealing with the realm of theoretical computer science, the term automata
is used to describe a machine that can be in one of a finite number of states
at any given time. The machine can be in only one state at a time, and the
machine can change from one state to another in response to some external
input.

An example of an automata is a vending machine. The machine can be in one of
four states: waiting for money, waiting for a selection, dispensing product, or dispensing change. The machine can only be in one state at a time, and the machine can
change from one state to another in response to the user inserting money,
selecting a product, or pressing the return button.

The automata can be described by a state diagram. The state diagram for the
following automata is as follows:
