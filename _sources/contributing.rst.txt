1. Click the "Fork" button at the top-right corner of the repository.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine using `git clone <repository-url>`.

## Step 2: Create a New Branch

Before making any changes, create a new branch to work in.

1. Navigate to the cloned directory.
2. Create a new branch using `git checkout -b <branch-name>`.
3. Make sure the branch name is descriptive and relevant to the changes you plan to make.

## Step 3: Make Your Changes

Work on the changes within your newly created branch.

1. Edit the files as needed.
2. Commit the changes using descriptive commit messages with `git commit -m "Your descriptive message here"`.

## Step 4: Push Changes to GitHub

Push the changes to your forked repository on GitHub.

1. Use `git push origin <branch-name>` to push the changes.

## Step 5: Create a Pull Request (Merge Request)

Create a pull request to propose your changes to the original project.

1. Navigate to the "Pull Requests" tab on the main repository.
2. Click the "New Pull Request" button.
3. Choose your fork and the branch you worked on.
4. Describe your changes and why they should be included.
5. Click "Create Pull Request."

## Step 6: Ensure All Tests Pass

Before your changes can be merged, they must pass all automated tests.

1. Look for any notifications or messages regarding failing tests.
2. If needed, make necessary adjustments to your code.
3. Push the changes again and ensure the tests pass.

## Step 7: Respond to Feedback

Maintainers may review your pull request and provide feedback.

1. Respond to any comments or requests for changes as needed.
